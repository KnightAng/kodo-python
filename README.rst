About
-----

kodo-python contains a set of high-level Python bindings for the Kodo Network
Coding C++ library. The bindings provide access to basic functionality provided
by Kodo, such as encoding and decoding data. The examples folder contains
sample applications showing the usage of the Python API.

Requirements
------------

First of all, follow `this Getting Started guide
<http://docs.steinwurf.com/getting_started.html>`_ to install
the basic tools required for the compilation (C++11 compiler, Git, Python).

The compilers used by Steinwurf are listed at the bottom of the
`buildbot page <http://buildbot.steinwurf.com>`_.

Linux
.....

If you use Anaconda, you'd better deactivate the environment by ``conda deactivate`` first.

These steps may not work with your specific Linux distribution, but they may
guide you in the right direction.

First, acquire the required packages from your package management system::

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install python build-essential libpython-dev python-dev

If you are using Python 3, you'll need to install ``libpython3-dev python3-dev`` instead.

Mac OSX
.......

Install the latest XCode and Command Line Tools from the Mac Store.

Python 2.7 is pre-installed on OSX, and the required Python headers should
also be available. If you are having trouble with the pre-installed Python
version, then you can install a more recent Python version with MacPorts or
Homebrew.

If you are running Homebrew on OSX 10.14 Mojave, then you should be aware that
Homebrew's Python 2.7.15 has some broken include paths, so we cannot compile
C++ Python modules with that version. To work around this issue, you can
downgrade to Python 2.7.14 using the following commands::

    cd /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula
    git log --follow python@2.rb
    git checkout -b python2-2.7.14_3 aa6726ba11
    brew reinstall ./python@2.rb
    brew pin python@2
    git checkout master

The ``brew pin`` command ensures that Python 2 will not be upgraded if
you run ``brew upgrade`` in the future.

Windows
.......

Install Python 2.7 (32-bit) and Visual Studio Express 2015 for Windows Desktop.
Then set the ``VS90COMNTOOLS`` environment variable to::

  C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\Tools\

so that Python distutils can detect your new compiler masquerading as
Visual Studio 2008 (which is the original compiler for Python 2.7).

distutils must be able to find a valid location for ``vcvarsall.bat`` and
it will call that batch file to obtain some compile flags. If you can execute
the following test script without getting an exception, then you should be able
to configure kodo-python using waf::

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        from distutils import log
        log.set_threshold(log.DEBUG)
        from distutils.msvccompiler import MSVCCompiler
        dist_compiler = MSVCCompiler()
        dist_compiler.initialize()
        print("Compile options:")
        print(dist_compiler.compile_options)
        print("LDFLAGS:")
        print(dist_compiler.ldflags_shared)

If you only have Visual Studio 2017, then setting ``VS90COMNTOOLS`` is
not sufficient, because the location of ``vcvarsall.bat`` has changed with
respect to the Common Tools folder. In this case, you can apply this
one-liner patch to ``msvc9compiler.py`` in your ``Python27\Lib\distutils``
folder: https://bugs.python.org/file45916/vsforpython.diff

After this, you can set ``VS90COMNTOOLS`` to the folder that actually contains
``vcvarsall.bat`` (this depends on the version of VS2017 that you installed)::

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\WDExpress\VC\Auxiliary\Build
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Professional\VC\Auxiliary\Build
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build


Building From Source
--------------------

You need to build the Python bindings from source.

First, clone the project::

  git clone git@github.com:steinwurf/kodo-python.git

Configure and build the project::

  cd kodo-python
  python waf configure
  python waf build

After building the project, you should find the resulting ``kodo.so``,
``kodo.dylib`` or ``kodo.pyd`` file here (the actual path and extension
depend on your OS)::

  build/linux/kodo.so
  build/darwin/kodo.dylib
  build/win32/kodo.pyd

You can copy this file to the same folder as your Python scripts, or you
can copy it to your PYTHONPATH (so that you can import it from anywhere).

Then you can import the module in your Python script::

  >>> import kodo

Special Options
...............

With the ``enable_codecs`` option, you can configure kodo-python to only enable
some desired codecs and disable all others. For example::

    python waf configure --enable_codecs=rlnc

Run ``python waf --help`` to list the available codecs. You can even
select multiple codecs with a comma-separated list::

    python waf configure --enable_codecs=rlnc,fulcrum

Compilation Issues on Linux
...........................

The compilation process might take a long time on certain Linux systems if
less than 4 GB RAM is available. The g++ optimizer might consume a lot of RAM
during the compilation, so if you see that all your RAM is used up, then
you can try to constrain the number of parallel jobs to only one during the
build step::

    python waf build -j 1

With this change, a fast compilation is possible with only 2 GB RAM.

This issue is specific to g++ (which is the default compiler on Linux), and
the RAM usage and the compilation time can be much better with clang.
The code produced by clang is also fast.

If the compilation does not work with g++, then you can install clang like
this (on Ubuntu and Debian)::

    sudo apt-get install clang

Then you can configure the project to use clang++::

    CXX=clang++ python waf configure

Compiling on the Raspberry Pi
.............................

The detailed instructions for compiling the project on the Raspberry Pi
are found in our `Raspberry guide
<https://github.com/steinwurf/kodo-python/blob/master/RASPBERRY_GUIDE.rst>`_.
